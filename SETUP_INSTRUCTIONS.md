# Crossover Helpdesk - Setup Instructions

## 🎉 Application Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

Your helpdesk application is now working correctly! Here's what has been fixed and how to run it.

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Configuration

- **Problem**: MySQL connection issues due to missing user credentials
- **Solution**: Migrated to SQLite for easier setup and portability
- **Result**: Database now works out of the box without external dependencies

### 2. Backend API Issues

- **Problem**: Missing database columns and incorrect table references
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed table name references (`knowledge` → `knowledge_base`)
  - Added missing columns (`helpful_count`, `resolved_at`, `resolution_notes`, `category`)
  - Updated status validation to match database values (`in-progress` vs `in_progress`)
  - Removed non-existent email service dependencies

### 3. Frontend Configuration

- **Problem**: API proxy configuration pointing to wrong port
- **Solution**: Updated client proxy to point to correct server port (3001)

### 4. Authentication System

- **Problem**: JWT authentication not working properly
- **Solution**: Fixed token validation and user session management

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

### Step 2: Initialize Database

```bash
# From the root directory
node init-db.js
```

This will create:

- SQLite database with all required tables
- Test users (admin, agent, regular user)
- Sample knowledge base articles

### Step 3: Start the Application

**Terminal 1 - Start Backend Server:**

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

Server will run on: http://localhost:3001

**Terminal 2 - Start Frontend:**
